Task 1. Write a C++ console program to convert numbers from
decimal number system in Roman to the largest Roman numeral (3999).

Task 2. Write a C++ console program to convert numbers from Roman
a number (1 to 3999) in the decimal number system.

Task 3. Write a C++ console program to display on the screen whether given
a real number belongs to a programmer-defined interval with a constant start and end
[MIN, MAX]. Use defining constants through directives.

Task 4. Write a C++ console program to display each digit on the screen
of a user-entered random integer.

Task 5. To study how the rand() function works and what it is used for. Make expressions,
including a call to this function so you can generate a pseudo integer
a number in a user-specified range. Then complete the functionality of
program by printing the digits of the number so generated (each on a new line) if and only if
the number has at most 3 digits.

Task 6. Investigate how the rand() function can generate random numbers. Compose
expression by which you can generate a random real number in a specified interval.
