Problem 1. Using the higher-order function prod, find:
a) xn, where x is a real number and n is a natural number.
b) n!, where n is a given natural number.
All values ​​to be set by the user!

Problem 2. Using the higher-order functions sum and prod,
find:
a) S = x − x3/3! + x5/5! − x7/7! + ⋯ + −1 ^ n (x ^ 2n+1 / 2n+1!).
b) S = 1 − x2/2! + x4/4! − x6/6! + ⋯ + −1 ^ n (x^2𝑛/ 2n!).
Values ​​for x and n to be set by the user!

Problem 3. The natural numbers n, m and a are given. By being used
higher-order functions to evaluate the value of the expression
𝑦 = n^ E 𝑖𝑖=1 * m^П j=1 -> a+j/i+j
The values ​​for n, m and a are set by the user!

Task 4. To define a higher-order function that implements the whole
one-argument function f over the elements with even sequence number of any diagonal parallel to the main diagonal of an integer
square matrix and the entire one-argument function g over the elements c odd consecutive number on each diagonal parallel to the main
diagonal of the square matrix. Crawl to start from element
from the lower left corner, which is assumed to be sequence number 0. No use data structures other than a two-dimensional array (square matrix)! All values ​​to be set by the user!
